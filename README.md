# vexer
A simple CLI to build VEXCode V5 Pro projects and download them to the V5 brain. (WIP)

This currently is only tested on and only works on windows

build a project by opening the command line in the folder your project is in and run `"path-to-vexer-exe" build .`

### Plans for this project:
* allow for building and downloading vexcode projects on multiple platforms
* support viewing the brain's terminal
* make a vscode extention?


### Requirements
* VEXCode V5 Pro installed
